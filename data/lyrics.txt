I'm so happy you're too good for me You're too good for me My heart's made of gold At least that's what I've been told But the flowers in my soul are getting old I'm so happy you're too good for me You're too good for me My eyes might be cold But my hands are nice to hold So just promise to not let go Say you won't I'm so happy you're too good for me You're too good for me I'm so happy you're too good for me You're too good for me
