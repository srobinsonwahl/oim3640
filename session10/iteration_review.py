When to use for loop:

- When we know the know the exact number or iterations, akak the # of times to repeat a code block.
- When we want to iterate through a collection of items or a sequence, such as 
    - a string
    - a list
    - a tuple
    - a dictionary
    - a set

When to use a while loop:

- When we don't know the know the exact number or iterations, akak the # of times to repeat a code block, but we know when or at what condition to not stop.
- When we want to repetitively execute a block of code forever, until at some codition it breaks out/returns (in a function)
